# Flash-Chat


It's an app, that imitates the functionality of chat messengers, where you can sing in, log in and log out. In this app we are using a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud. So, in process of making this app i integrated third party libraries using CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager. 

        What i learned in the process of creating this application:
        * How to install, work and use third party libraries.
        * How to store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
        * How to query and sort the Firebase database. 
        * How to work with UITableViews and how to set their data sources and delegates.
        * How to create and use custom views using .xib files to modify our app.
        * How to create seques and work with them.
